This is a project for a General Assembly course.

The idea is to create a social network wherein no one controls their own profile page. Instead, everyone else controls the content of your profile. A user cannot edit their own profile, and all additions are made anonymously. Content cannot be directly deleted, but rather any addition is upvoted or downvoted, or marked as true or false.

The hope is to strip away the glorification of self-images, allowing the community to reach truth about a person, rather than a carefully packaged show. There are many obvious concerns.
